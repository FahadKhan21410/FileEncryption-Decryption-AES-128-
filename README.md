# FileEncryption-Decryption-AES-128
* Helps encrypt & decrypt your private files using AES-128

## Features
* Encrypt files using AES-128
* Uses a **32-character hex key** (16 bytes, randomized).
* Includes a **standalone decryptor** for sharing encrypted files with others.

## Tech Stack
* Python
* **PyCryptodome** (Crypto library for AES)
* **AES (CBC Mode)**

## Development Environment
* Tested with **PyCharm IDE**
* Python 3.7+ recommended

## Project Structure
* /FileEncryption(AES).py -> Main Script: Used for encrypting and decrypting files
* /AES-128_decryptor.py -> Standalone decryptor (can be shared with users along with encrypted file + key)

## How To Run
* Clone repository (bash: git clone https://github.com/username/project.git) or Download as ZIP
* Open the code file in IDE that supports python
* Install required dependencies: **pip install pycryptodome**
